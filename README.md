2. Assessment of Home Network Vulnerabilities
Objective: Evaluate the network infrastructure and identify potential security weaknesses.
Router and Modem Configuration:
Review Settings:
Examined router and modem settings, including firewall rules, port forwarding configurations, and remote management options.
Applied Security Best Practices:
Utilized strong, unique 12-digit passwords.
Disabled remote management features were unnecessary.
Regularly updated firmware to patch known vulnerabilities.
Configured router to use WPA3 encryption protocol for enhanced wireless security.
Ensured outdated protocols like WEP were disabled and secure protocols were enforced for all network communications.
Password Updates:
Password Management:
Updated default passwords on all network devices to strong, unique passwords.
Implemented Bitwarden password manager to securely track and generate passwords.
Network Monitoring Tools:
Deployment:
Deployed network monitoring tools such as Wireshark to continuously monitor network traffic for unusual or suspicious activity.
Set up alerts for anomalies or deviations from normal network behavior.
Regular Audits:
Frequency:
Scheduled periodic security audits to reassess and update security measures, including device configurations and data protection practices.
Updates and Patches:
Apply Updates:.
Example: Installed the latest firmware updates for routers and applied security patches for operating systems.
